/**
 * Runtime launcher for @yawlabs/mcp-compliance.
 *
 * Prefers the oam runtime (https://oamjs.org) and falls back to the Node
 * process already running this file. The CLI itself (`dist/index.js`) is
 * runtime-agnostic -- a pre-bundled ESM entry using only `node:` builtins that
 * oam implements -- so neither path changes behavior.
 *
 * WHY THE FALLBACK COSTS NOTHING
 * npm has already started Node to run this launcher, so falling back is a plain
 * `import()` of the CLI into THIS process: no extra spawn, no extra startup,
 * byte-identical to invoking dist/index.js directly. Discovery is stat-only --
 * never a subprocess -- so the miss case stays sub-millisecond.
 *
 * WHAT THE OAM PATH COSTS
 * Reaching oam through an npm `bin` means Node boots first and oam boots second,
 * so the launcher is slower than either runtime alone. To skip it, point at oam
 * directly: `oam run <abs>/dist/index.js -- <args>`.
 *
 * ALREADY RUNNING ON OAM
 * A host can resolve this package's `bin` and launch `oam run <this file>`
 * instead of `node <this file>` -- Yaw MCP does, and so does oam's sidecar
 * regression matrix. This launcher used to discover oam and spawn it anyway,
 * so one server cost two runtime boots: measured on Windows, oam.exe with a
 * NESTED oam.exe + conhost.exe underneath it. Now, when `process.versions.oam`
 * clears the same MINIMUM OAM VERSION a discovered binary has to, the CLI is
 * imported into THIS process exactly as the Node fallback is -- no discovery,
 * no `oam --version` probe, no second oam. OAM_BIN is a discovery input, so it
 * is not consulted on that path: the host has already chosen which oam runs.
 *
 * Nothing is lost by skipping the spawn, because there is no sandbox to apply
 * (see below) and the floor is the same one: a host oam that clears it has the
 * same `child_process` a discovered one would. A host oam BELOW the floor gets
 * no shortcut: it takes the discovery path exactly as it always did.
 *
 * NO SANDBOX HERE -- DELIBERATELY
 * oam 0.9.0's `--permission` is real hardening, but this tool cannot use it.
 * Its entire job is to spawn an arbitrary MCP server command supplied by the
 * caller (src/transport/stdio.ts) or connect to an arbitrary target URL, so the
 * child-process and network grants would both have to be unrestricted, and it
 * reads caller-supplied config files off disk. Every grant would be wide open,
 * so `--permission` is not offered rather than shipped as security theatre.
 *
 * MINIMUM OAM VERSION
 * 0.9.0, and this tool is the strongest case for the floor in the whole
 * @yawlabs/*-mcp set. Below it, oam's `child_process` diverged from Node in ways
 * that corrupt a compliance harness specifically:
 *
 *   - `stdio` was ignored entirely: `'inherit'` and `'ignore'` both behaved as
 *     `'pipe'`. A stdio MCP transport is nothing BUT its stdio wiring, so a run
 *     under an older oam measures the runtime's bug, not the server's compliance.
 *   - `execFile` ran its arguments through a SHELL. This suite deliberately
 *     sends OS-command-injection payloads (`; cat /etc/passwd`, `$(whoami)`,
 *     backtick-id) to assert the server under test does NOT execute them. If the
 *     HARNESS's own runtime re-splits and executes those payloads first, the
 *     result is a false verdict on the exact property being tested -- in the
 *     dangerous direction, because the harness would attribute its own execution
 *     to the server.
 *   - `spawnSync` truncated at `maxBuffer` while reporting success, so a large
 *     tools/list response could be silently cut and still look like a pass.
 *
 * An older oam is not an error: the launcher falls back to Node and says so on
 * stderr. Pinning the floor here is what makes that fallback automatic, and for
 * this tool a silent downgrade to Node is strictly the right outcome.
 *
 * SELECTION
 *   MCP_COMPLIANCE_RUNTIME=oam    require oam; fail loudly if it is missing
 *                                 (already running on oam satisfies it)
 *   MCP_COMPLIANCE_RUNTIME=node   never use oam
 *   MCP_COMPLIANCE_RUNTIME=auto   prefer oam, silently fall back (default)
 *   OAM_BIN=/path/to/oam          explicit binary, checked before any discovery
