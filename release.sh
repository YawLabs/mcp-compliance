# Release Script -- local + CI dual mode: test, lint, bump, tag, publish, release
# =============================================================================
# Usage:
#   ./release.sh <version>     e.g. ./release.sh 0.14.2   -- local end-to-end
#   ./release.sh               -- CI mode (derives version from $GITHUB_REF_NAME)
#
# If interrupted, re-run with the same version -- each step is idempotent.
#
# Prerequisites for LOCAL runs (one-time setup on this machine):
#   - Node.js 20+
#   - npm authenticated as a publisher of @yawlabs/mcp-compliance via an
#     AUTOMATION token in ~/.npmrc (npmjs.com -> Access Tokens -> Generate
#     -> Automation), i.e. these two lines:
#       @yawlabs:registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
#       //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=npm_YOURTOKEN
#     Do NOT use 'npm login --auth-type=web' -- it OVERWRITES that automation
#     token with a 2FA-bound web session, and the next publish then EOTPs on a
#     WebAuthn challenge (any CI sharing the token starts failing too).
#   - GitHub CLI authenticated
#       gh auth login
#
# Prerequisites for CI runs:
#   - $CI=true
#   - $GITHUB_REF_NAME=vX.Y.Z (set automatically by the tag-push trigger)
#   - $NODE_AUTH_TOKEN populated from secrets.NPM_TOKEN (org-level)
#   - $GITHUB_TOKEN populated automatically by Actions
#
# Either path produces an identical artifact; the typical workflow is to bump
# + commit + tag + push locally and let CI handle the publish steps via the
# tag-push trigger in .github/workflows/release.yml.

# SKIP_LINT=1 escape hatch -- wraps `npm`/`pnpm` so lint-related runs are
# no-ops.
#
# THIS SHOULD NOW BE UNNECESSARY, and reaching for it is a signal something
# regressed. `npm run lint` routes through scripts/lint.mjs, which runs biome
# at the version this repo's lockfile installs, on a binary that works on the
# host. On Windows ARM64 that means the x64 build of that same version under
# emulation, because the native arm64 build of SOME biome releases crashes
# rather than running -- measured on that host: 2.5.4 exits 139, while 2.4.16
# and 2.5.13 run correctly. Verified: `npm run lint` exits 0 there.
#
# Two things the earlier text here got wrong, recorded so they do not get
# re-diagnosed. It blamed "the MINGW64-ARM64 npm-run-script wrapper": `npm run`
# is fine on that host, and a plain node script through the same wrapper exits
# 0. And the crash is not a permanent property of arm64 -- it is specific to
# the biome release installed, which is why the wrapper provisions the x64
# build of THAT version rather than assuming the architecture is broken.
#
# The earlier text also justified skipping with "CI catches lint regressions
# anyway". This repo has NO CI -- its workflows were removed in fe1185a and
# Actions is disabled on the repository -- so nothing downstream re-checks
# formatting. Skipping the lint step means the release is published unlinted,
# full stop.
#
# So: only set SKIP_LINT=1 if scripts/lint.mjs cannot produce a result at all,
# and treat that as a bug to fix rather than a step to routinely skip. Step 1
# runs `npm run lint || fail`, so a crashed linter already stops the release --
# there is no "lint is UNVERIFIED, carry on" path here, and none should be added.
